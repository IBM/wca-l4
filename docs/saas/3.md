# **Configure the enterprise Java environment**</br>*IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration*

## **i. Objectives and rationale**

As participants will be working with the IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) Standard Plan and interacting with enterprise Java applications, they will need to perform some additional configuration of their Windows or MacOS machines before setting up the extensions (or plug-ins) to the WCA service.

Locally you must **install** *both* Java and Apache Maven. Details and download links for the two are summarized in the table below.

**Java Requirements**

| Distribution | Details | Resources |
| - | - | - |
| **Java** | Java SE 11 with Java Developer Kit 11, or a later version. | **<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" target="_blank">Download</a>** |
| **Maven** | Use Maven to build your application. If you are using Liberty Tools and the Liberty Maven plug-in to build your app or project, use at least Maven 3.8.6. | **<a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank">Download</a>** |

## **ii. Java installation**

</br>

1. **Download** and **install** the latest Java SDKs using the vendor link below. It is recommended that you install Java SE 11 with Java Developer Kit 11, or a later version.

    !!! warning ""
        
        **URL:** **<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" target="_blank">https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>**

    Follow the prompts of the installation wizard and complete the installation before continuing to Step 2.

---

2. With your preferred Java distribution installed locally, you now need to set the appropriate environment variables.

    Find the Java installation path on your local machine using the instruction set that corresponds to your local operating system.

    - **macOS:** Open a Terminal and execute: `/usr/libexec/java_home`
        - The output should resemble something like: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home`
    - **Windows:** Open a Command Prompt and execute: `echo %JAVA_HOME%`
        - If the `JAVA_HOME` variable has not yet been set, the Java installations are typically located in the `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX.X.X` directory

---

3. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

    - **macOS:** Edit the shell configuration file
        - Default shell (`zsh`) with Terminal: `nano ~/.zshrc`
        - Alternatively, older shell (`bash`) with Terminal: `nano ~/.bash_profile`
        - **Add** the following line to the file:
        ``` shell
        bash<br>export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)<br>
        ```
        - **Save** (++ctrl++ + ++o++) and **exit** (++ctrl++ + ++x++) the editor
    - **Windows:**
        - Open the **Start** menu and search for `Environment Variables`
        - Select *Edit the system environment variables* option
        - Click the **Environment Variables** button
        - Under *System Variables*, click **New**
        - Set the *Variable Name* = `JAVA_HOME` and *Variable Value* = *JDK path from Step 9* (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`)
        - Click **OK** to finalize

---

4. Apply the changes immediately.
    - **macOS**: Run *either* of these commands with Terminal
        - For `zsh` shell: `source ~/.zshrc`
        - For `bash` shell: `source ~/.bash_profile`
    - **Windows:**
        - Close all open command prompts or terminals
        - Open a *new* Command Prompt to pick up the changes

---

5. Verify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable has been correctly set.
    - **macOS:**
        - With Terminal, execute: `bash<br>echo $JAVA_HOME<br>`
        - The console will return the Java installation path
    - **Windows:**
        - With Command Prompt, execute: `cmd<br>echo %JAVA_HOME%<br>`
        - The console will return the Java installation path

---

## **iii. Maven installation**

</br>

6. **Download** and **install** the latest Maven distribution using either the MacOS or Windows instruction sets below.
    - **macOS:**
        - The simplest method is using <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank">**Homebrew**</a> to install and deploy Maven locally. To install Homebrew, execute the following with Terminal:
        ```
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        ```
        - With Terminal, execute:
        ```
        brew install maven
        ```
        - Follow the prompts (confirming with `yes` if asked to confirm the install)
        - After the install process has concluded, test with Terminal:
        ```
        mvn --version
        ```
    - **Windows:**
        - Visit the official Maven website: <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank">https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi</a>
        - Under **Files**, click on the binary zip archive link (for example, `apache-maven-x.x.x-bin.zip`)
        - Extract the zip file to a location on your local machine (for example, `C:\Apache\maven\`)
        - **Replace** `<path-to-folder>` with your machine's installation path and then execute the following with Command Prompt:
        ```
        MAVEN_HOME= <path-to-folder>\maven\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9
        ```
        - **Replace** `<path-to-folder>` with your machine's installation path and then execute the following with Command Prompt:
        ```
        <path-to-folder>\maven\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin
        ```
        - Maven is now successfully installed and configured

## **iv. Determine the JDK**

For Visual Studio (VS) Code and WCA Standard Plans, watsonx Code Assistant needs to determine the Java developer kit (JDK) to use, in the following order of precedence:

| Order of precedence | Description |
| - | - |
| **1** | Globally-configured Java developer kit for automatic building in the Red Hat extension, which is `java.configuration.runtimes` in the IDE `settings.json` file |
| **2** | `java.jdt.ls.java.home` or `java.home` IDE settings if they are present |
| **3** | `JAVA_HOME` system environment variable, or else `JDK_HOME` |
| **4** | The Java developer kit in the system `PATH` |

When WCA Standard Plan features are used, such as Java modernization or upgrade, you can verify which Java developer kit is being used:
    
- Within the VS Code IDE, click **View** and then **Output**
- In the *Output* view, use the dropdown menu to select **WCA**
- Look for a message such as `Using the Java developer kit that is defined in <location> to run watsonx Code Assistant components. The path is: <path>` to determine the feature currently in use

---

## **v. Set the logging level**

To adjust logging for the VS Code extension for WCA:

- From the **Extensions** panel of VS Code, locate the WCA extension and right-click to pull down a list of available options
- Select the **Extension Settings** option
- Scroll down (or search) for **WCA: Log level**
- You may adjust this field from the default `INFO` setting to alternative options (like `WARN`) to cycle between various logging levels

---

## **vi. Next steps**

In the following modules, participants will prepare the WCA extensions and plug-ins for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse IDE, respectively.
