# **Basic migration capabilities**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*

!!! quote "TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

## **i. Incentives to modernize**

Lariat Corporation has a large collection of **WebSphere Enterprise Archive** (EAR) applications designed specifically for deployments using **WAS**. These are packaged archive files that bundle together multiple Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE shorthand, or more recently referred to by Jakarta EE) components: web modules, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) files, resource adapters, libraries, and so on. Collectively, all of these components allow for Lariat's engineers and developers to manage complex enterprise applications "efficiently" (as the theory goes) by encapsulating all of the necessary components into a single, structured archive. 

**Liberty**, however, supports comparatively simple and standardized configurations that greatly reduce the complexities found with WAS applications. Namely: by removing the need for multiple external descriptors and consolidating settings into one unified file (`server.xml`). Overally, this approach improves the maintainability of the code base in the long term and improves the deployment speed for new instances (or versions) of the Liberty-based application.

As part of the modernization efforts, the new Liberty application will need to support the functionality of the legacy WAS application, such as:

- Deployment of complex, modular Java EE applications onto WebSphere servers
- Encapsulation of web applications, EJB modules, and dependencies in a structured format
- Facilitate version control, deployment, and existing rollback strategies to guarantee consistent and reliable production environments

In general, the team supporting the modernization anticipate that Liberty will enable greatly simplified, more modular deployment structures — which in turn will reduce the overhead, complexity, and maintenance burden of these applications.

## **ii. WebSphere legacy code**

First, examine the legacy code (below), which as mentioned previously is a snapshot of a larger WebSphere EAR application. 

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- application.xml -->
    <application>
        <module>
            <web>
                <web-uri>legacyapp.war</web-uri>
                <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
            </web>
        </module>
        <module>
            <ejb>legacyEJB.jar</ejb>
        </module>
        <security-role>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
        </security-role>
    </application>

    <!-- ibm-web-bnd.xml -->
    <web-bnd>
        <virtual-host name="default_host" />
        <resource-ref name="jdbc/LegacyDS" binding-name="jdbc/LegacyDS" />
    </web-bnd>
    ```

</br>
The application defines two modules— `legacyapp.war` and `legacyEJB.jar` —which denote the web and EJB components of the application, respectively (lines 5 and 10).

- The code sets a specific context root to access the `legacyapp.war` web module.
- It also introduces WebSphere-specific bindings such as `ibm-web-bnd.xml` (beginning on line 17), which are employed for virtual hosting and resource references.
- Security roles and resource bindings are managed externally through the use of XML.

The legacy code showcased here has a particular structural element that makes it a prime candidate for this type of Liberty modernization. Chiefly, the EAR application uses *separate* XML descriptors like `application.xml` (line 1) and `ibm-web-bnd.xml` (line 17) to define distinct modules. This setup, at enterprise scale, becomes cumbersome to maintain and can often result in frequent deployment delays (or human-induced configuration errors) each time the modules need to be modified. The maintenance burden of this more intricate structural design can be reduced with a more simplified, Liberty-based approach.

## **iii. Liberty modernized code**

Consider below the modernized (but functionally equivalent) application code with Liberty:

=== "WEBSPHERE LIBERTY"

    ``` xml linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
    <!-- server.xml -->
    <server>
        <featureManager>
            <feature>webProfile-8.0</feature>
            <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
        </featureManager>

        <httpEndpoint host="*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" />

        <application id="modernapp" location="modernapp.war" context-root="/modernapp">
            <classloader delegation="parentLast" />
        </application>

        <dataSource id="jdbc/ModernDS" jndiName="jdbc/ModernDS">
            <jdbcDriver libraryRef="jdbcLib" />
            <connectionManager maxPoolSize="50" />
        </dataSource>

        <library id="jdbcLib">
            <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/jdbc" includes="*.jar" />
        </library>
    </server>
    ```

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1" hl_lines="1 17"
    <!-- application.xml -->
    <application>
        <module>
            <web>
                <web-uri>legacyapp.war</web-uri>
                <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
            </web>
        </module>
        <module>
            <ejb>legacyEJB.jar</ejb>
        </module>
        <security-role>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
        </security-role>
    </application>

    <!-- ibm-web-bnd.xml -->
    <web-bnd>
        <virtual-host name="default_host" />
        <resource-ref name="jdbc/LegacyDS" binding-name="jdbc/LegacyDS" />
    </web-bnd>
    ```
!!! note "BREVITY: DISPELLING MODERNIZATION MISCONCEPTIONS"
    The Liberty application code snippet is in fact "longer", in terms of lines of code, than the legacy WAS predecessor application. This raises an important point about modernized application code: *the brevity and terseness of an application's code does not always reflect more efficient or practical code.*
    
    What is important to the success and value of modernization efforts is that the new code is more appropriate to the tasks to be performed, has greater efficacy than before, and is more easily maintained — or a combination of these factors. Whether that is achieved in fewer lines of code than before is ultimately far less important.

</br>
The modernized Liberty application code streamlines the original WebSphere configuration details into a *single* WAR file (`server.xml`) with clear, unified definitions.

- Legacy EAR files have been consolidated into more lightweight Web Archive (WAR) structure. 
- WebSphere-specific descriptors, like `ibm-web-bnd.xml` and `ibm-web-ext.xml`, have been converted into modern Liberty features.
- WebSphere-specific APIs and deprecated components, like *AdminClient APIs* or *Java Naming and Directory Interface (JDNI)* look-ups, have been replaced.
- Liberty WAR configuration file uses `parentLast` (line 11) class loading to ensure that the application's resources take precedence.
- JDBC configurations are directly defined alongside the application deployment, removing the need for external bindings.

Ultimately, the modernized Liberty application code supports Lariat's objectives of simplified, modular deployment structures that reduce the overhead and technical burdens placed on developers maintaining the legacy WebSphere code base.
