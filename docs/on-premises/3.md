# **Bastion Host Setup**</br>*On-Premises Installation and Deployment*

!!! quote ""
    The following section is based off of IBM Documentation write-ups that detail how to install IBM Software Hub on a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Reference the instructions in full at the following resource: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.1.x?topic=workstation-installing-software-hub-cli" target="_blank">**Installing the IBM Software Hub command-line interface**</a>.

## **i. Connect to the bastion host**

Before configuring the bastion host node, you will need to retrieve its connectivity and access control details.

---

1. Return to the **<a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations" target="_blank">My Reservations</a>** page on the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) and open the dashboard for the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.

---

2. Scroll down to the bottom of the summary page and locate the following key-value pairs related to the bastion host node. Copy these to a notepad for reference later:

    - *Bastion Password*
    - *Bastion RDP Address*
    - *Bastion SSH Connection*
    - *Bastion Username*

    </br>
    There are also key-value pairs related to the OCP cluster that, for convenience, you should also record at this time â€” they will be used in later parts of the lab:

    - *Cluster Admin Username*
    - *Cluster Admin Password*
    - *OCP Console*

---

3. Open a Terminal (Windows Terminal or the Terminal built into VS Code are good alternatives if you're on a PC). Copy the *Bastion SSH Connection* recorded in Step 2 and paste it into the terminal console. Hit ++return++ to execute and create an SSH connection to the bastion host.

    - When prompted *Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?*, enter `yes` and hit ++return++ to proceed.

    - The console will return a *Welcome to IBM Technology Zone* once connected to the bastion host, at which point you must authenticate.

    - **Authenticate** when prompted to do so by providing the *Bastion Password* recorded in Step 2.

    - If the console now reads `[itzuser@localhost ~]$` then you have successfully accessed the bastion host.

---

## **ii. OpenShift command line interface (oc)**

Next, install the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI), designated `oc`, to programmatically perform work with the bastion node.

---

4. **Retrieve** the *OCP dashboard URL* (recorded in Step 8 of the previous module). Obtain the *OpenShift base domain* by extracting the portion of the URL that matches the position highlighted in the sample URL below. Extract the portion after `.apps.` until the end of the URL. The characters in *your* OCP dashboard URL will differ.

    !!! note ""
        https://console-openshift-console.apps.**678a250b79141644e78804e0.ocp.techzone.ibm.com**

    - In this example, the value of the *OpenShift base domain* is `678a250b79141644e78804e0.ocp.techzone.ibm.com`

    - Record *your* OCP cluster's value to a notepad for future reference.

---

5. The following instruction set, when executed within a Terminal window, will install the OpenShift CLI on the bastion host node. However, the instructions require some modification before they will successfully execute.

    </br>
    **Install OpenShift CLI**
    ``` shell hl_lines="1"
    export OPENSHIFT_BASE_DOMAIN=<CHANGE_ME>
    wget --no-check-certificate https://downloads-openshift-console.apps.${OPENSHIFT_BASE_DOMAIN}/amd64/linux/oc.tar
    tar -xvf oc.tar
    chmod +x oc
    sudo mv oc /usr/local/bin/oc
    ```

    - Copy the instructions above and paste into a notepad.

    - Replace the highlighted `<CHANGE_ME>` text with the *OpenShift base domain* value recorded in Step 4.

    - Copy the modified notepad instructions to your clipboard and paste into your Terminal console.

    - Press ++return++ to execute the instructions.

---

6. The installation should only take a few minutes to complete. Once finished, try typing `oc` into the console window and hit ++return++. The console output should verify that `oc` (the OpenShift CLI) has been successfully installed on the bastion host.

---

## **iii. Podman install **

IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)'s installer requires containers and as such Podman must be set up on the bastion host ahead of time. 

---

7. Using the connected Terminal console, **execute** the following instruction to install Podman:

    ``` shell
    sudo yum install -y podman
    ```

    The process will take approximately 1 minute to complete.

---

## **iv. Environment variables **

Next, you must set the environment variables needed for installation of CP4D on the cluster. The list is quite extensive and long, so rather than set these one at a time it's recommended that you first compile them into a single file on the bastion host. Afterwards you can set all the variables automatically using the single file.

---

8. Below is a code block containing all of the necessary CP4D environment variables. **Copy** the contents of the entire block to your clipboard and **paste** into a notepad.

9. You must make **modifications** to **Line 19**, **Line 23**, and **Line 49** of the *CP4D Environment Variables* to tailor the variables to *your* specific cluster.

    - **Line 19:** set the value of `export OCP_URL=` equal to the value of *OCP dashboard URL* that was recorded in Step 8 of the previous module. For example:

        !!! note ""
            ``` shell
            export OCP_URL=https://console-openshift-console.apps.678a250b79141644e78804e0.ocp.techzone.ibm.com
            ```

    - **Line 23:** set the value of `export OCP_PASSWORD=` equal to the value of *Cluster Admin Password* recorded in Step 2 of this module. For example:

        !!! note ""
            ``` shell
            export OCP_PASSWORD=password1234
            ```

    - **Line 49:** set the value of `export IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=` equal to the value of the key specific to *your* IBM account. Reference the *IBM Entitlement API Key* that was generated in the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/on-premises/1/#ii-infrastructure-and-resource-requirements" target="_blank">**iii. Prerequisites checklist section of Module 1 (Objectives and Requirements)**</a>. Instructions for how to generate an *IBM Entitlement API Key* are provided in that section. For example:

        !!! note ""
            ``` shell
            export IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=verylongAPIkey1234
            ```

---

10. With your Terminal console, execute the following instruction to open the **vi** editor and create a shell script named `cpd_vars.sh` on the bastion host:

    ``` shell
    vi cpd_vars.sh
    ```

    - **Copy** the modified *CP4D Environment Variables* contents from the notepad (Step 9) to your machine's clipboard.

    - Switch back to the Terminal where the VI editor is now open and press the ++i++ key to enable inserting text.
    
    - Press ++cmd++ + ++v++ (or ++ctrl++ + ++v++) to paste the contents from your clipboard.

    - To save, press ++esc++ and then type `:wq` followed by ++return++ to write the file and exit the editor.

---

## **v. Cloud Pak for Data command line interface (cpd-cli) **

Now that the environment variables have been set, the next step towards installing CP4D is preparing the command line interface (`cpd-cli`). 

---

11. **Execute** the following command in the Terminal console so that subsequent actions taken are done with elevated permissions:

    ``` shell
    sudo bash
    ```

    Then copy the following code block and execute it within the console to install `cpd-cli`. Installation should only take a few moments to complete.

    ``` shell
    wget https://github.com/IBM/cpd-cli/releases/download/v14.1.0/cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.1.0.tgz
    tar -xzf cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.1.0.tgz
    export PATH="$(pwd)/cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.1.0-1189":$PATH
    ```

---

12. Verify that the CLI has been successfully integrated by typing `cpd-cli` and then ++return++ into the console.

---

13. Engage the command line interface and ensure that the Terminal console is executing all subsequent instructions with full (root) privileges:

    ``` shell
    echo $PATH
    cpd-cli manage restart-container
    ```

    This step will take a minute or two before completing. Once it has completed, you can verify the status of the restarted container by typing `podman ps` and ++return++, which should return the result of a single container running on the bastion host.

---

14. Source the newly-configured environment variables with the following command:

    ``` shell
    source cpd_vars.sh
    ```

---

15. Test that the login for `oc` command line is now functioning properly:

    ``` shell
    oc login ${OCP_URL} ${LOGIN_ARGUMENTS}
    ```

    The command line should return back with a prompt describing `You have access to ... projects` which indicates that `oc` and the environment variables have been correctly configured.

---

## **vi. Next steps **
        
At this stage the bastion host node has been fully configured ahead of installing the necessary software, which will be covered in the subsequent modules.

??? note "TROUBLESHOOTING: LOGGING IN AND SESSION TIMEOUTS"
    Be aware that SSH connections made over Terminal will time out after a long period of inactivity or due to a connection error. If you need to log back into the bastion terminal, follow the procedure below. Replace the `<BASTION_PWD>` placeholder with the password specific to *your* environment.

    1. Log back into the bastion node:

        ``` shell
        ssh itzuser@api.67828ca5e432cac47ccc4230.ocp.techzone.ibm.com -p 40222 <BASTION_PWD>
        ```
    
    2. Engage the `sudo` (privileged access) session:

        ``` shell
        sudo bash
        ```

    3. Source the environment variables stored in `cpd_vars.sh`:

        ``` shell
        source cpd_vars.sh
        ```

    4. Log back into OpenShift:

        ``` shell
        ${OC_LOGIN}
        ```

    5. Log back into `cpd-cli`:

        ``` shell
        ${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
        ```
