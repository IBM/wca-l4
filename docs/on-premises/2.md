    If you require assistance or run into issues with the hands-on lab, help is available.

    - **Environment issues:** The lab environment is managed by IBM Technology Zone. <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/help" target="_blank">**Opening a support case ticket**</a> is recommended for issues related to the hands-on environment (provisioning, running, and so on.)

    - **Documentation issues:** If there is an error in the lab documentation, or if you require additional support in completing the material, open a thread on the <a href="https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C063VF1G54J" target="_blank">**#wca-ansible-techzone-support**</a> Slack channel.

## **i. Configuring the IBM Technology Zone reservation**

The foundation for the on-premises environment utilizes the `OpenShift Cluster (VMware on IBM Cloud) - UPI - Public` template from the collection of <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/tech-zone-certified-base-images/journey-vmware-on-ibm-cloud-environments" target="_blank">**IBM Technolgy Zone (ITZ) Certified Base Images**</a>.

3. Supply additional details about the ITZ reservation request:

    !!! note "RESERVATON POLICY NOTICE"
        After selecting `Education` for the *Purpose* field, you may receive a pop-up notification stating that `this environment is now being redirected to the OCP base image hosted On-Prem for Education and Test`. You can safely **ignore** this notice and close it by clicking the *X* in the top-right corner.
        
        **Do not** configure using the Poughkeepsie-based resource that the notice attempts to redirect you to â€” it will not allow you to configure the necessary hardware specifications. Continue with the ITZ reservation request form as detailed below. If the pop-up appears again later in the configuration steps, continue to disregard the notice.

4. When satisfied, verify that you agree to the *Terms and Conditions* for the environment and finalize your reservation request by clicking **Submit**.

    Navigate to the **<a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations" target="_blank">My Reservations</a>** tab of the ITZ to monitor the progress of your reservation. Wait for the ITZ reservation to be marked as *"Ready"* before continuing.

    !!! warning "PROVISIONING TIMES"
        This operation will take approximately **90 - 120 minutes** to complete.
